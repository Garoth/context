Terminal UI dashboard for my workflow.

I tend to use tiled terminals (using iTerm2 or a tiling window manager), and I
can afford some of my screen realestate to be used as a persistent
dashboard for stuff I care about. Currently, this just has some stock
info.

The project uses Termbox-Go to render some basic widgets that will periodically
update themselves to show up to date content.
